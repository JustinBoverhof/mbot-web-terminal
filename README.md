# Mbot Web Terminal Concept
made with the help of chatgpt and this post:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38689707/connecting-to-remote-ssh-server-via-node-js-html5-console

this is meant to illustrate an idea for an addition to the mbot web services 

Web development is not my specialty and I do not claim to know what all of this code does

the main idea behind this was to provide a terminal for those not at their usual setup or for people doing demos who might not be tech savy but want to run a script on the robot like wall follower. commands like nano are usable in this terminal so in theory someone could code and run a robot just from this webpage. 

I am not sure how useful this would actually be as a feature but i think the concept is at least cool in practice.

## Dependancies 
npm and these npm packages: express socket.io ssh2 xterm xterm-addon-fit
